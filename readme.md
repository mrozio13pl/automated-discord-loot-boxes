Even though for some people loot boxes may appear like they have been removed from Discord app, the API is still up and running, which means you can still get the profile decoration if you haven't already!

## Setup

1. Download this git repo.
2. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer.
3. Open CMD in the directory where you have the repository installed.
4. Execute these commands:
    ```sh
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
5. Paste your discord token.

Done! 🎉

## Is it safe?

Probably yes, this program doesn't store your token anywhere. You have a higher chance of Discord banning you (for some reason), but the most likely won't care.

> 👉 Remember to never share your discord token!
